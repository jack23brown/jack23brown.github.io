## R/Python ML

In this project for STAT 551 at Cal Poly, we produced a mock document for the EPA that used machine learning to investigate air pollution and car dependency in the United States. We produced this analysis in two programming languages: R and Python. This project helped bolster my skills in both R and Python, allowing me to see the strengths and weaknesses of both languages in the context of machine learning, data visualization, and data summary.

## Network Analysis

My data science senior capstone project at Cal Poly was to create a network analysis framework for [the Global Emancipation Network]() to help combat human trafficking by identifying criminal networks in the illicit massage business industry. I worked on an interdisciplinary team with three other data science students: Bella White, Thea Yang, and Amara Zabback. The project took course over a 6 month period that consisted of comprehensive network planning and design, data collection from various publicly available sources, self-teaching of a graph database and visualization software (Neo4j), and an interactive network implementation.

For a comprehensive summary of the work we completed, please refer to the formal report we created below:
