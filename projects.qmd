## Machine Learning in R

In this project for STAT 551 at Cal Poly, we produced a mock document for the American Stroke Association and the Alzheimerâ€™s Association that used machine learning to help identify key risks of stroke and Alzheimer's. The predictive machine learning models we created can assist doctors in making proper diagnoses and quickly begin preventative or early treatment. This project demonstrates my machine learning, data visualization, and data summary skills in R.
