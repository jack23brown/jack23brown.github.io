Hello! I am a recent graduate from Cal Poly San Luis Obispo with my Master's of Science degree in Statistics. For those interested, I would describe myself as a versatile, pragmatic, and detail-oriented individual interested in the fields of statistics, project management, real estate, sports, and music. Through my experiences in academia, jobs/internships, sports, music, graphic design, media & marketing, and more, I have developed a wide-ranging skill set that allows me to succeed in many different environments. I am a creative thinker and great problem-solver, who takes pride in the quality of my work.
