The predictive machine learning models we created can assist doctors in making proper diagnoses and quickly begin preventative or early treatment. This project demonstrates my machine learning, data visualization, and data summary skills in R.\n\n\n\nMy thesis project for my Master of Science in Statistics degree at Cal Poly was an analysis of the impact of the. new Video Assistant Referee (VAR) technology in the biggest soccer league in the world, the English Premier League. The project process included extensive literature review, thorough statisical analysis using parametric and non-parametric methods, and web scraping, to which the code can be found here: https://github.com/jack23brown/Impact-of-VAR-on-the-EPL\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLogosFlyers/Posters"
