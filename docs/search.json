The predictive machine learning models we created can assist doctors in making proper diagnoses and quickly begin preventative or early treatment. This project demonstrates my machine learning, data visualization, and data summary skills in R.\n\n\n\nMy thesis project for my Master of Science in Statistics degree at Cal Poly was an analysis of the impact of the new Video Assistant Referee (VAR) technology in the biggest soccer league in the world, the English Premier League. The project process included extensive literature review, thorough statistical analysis using parametric and non-parametric methods, and web scraping, to which the code can be found here: https://github.com/jack23brown/Impact-of-VAR-on-the-EPL\n\n\n\nIn this project, I was given data set containing a vast collection of metrics on each school in the California State University school system and was told to “tell a story about the data”. As such, I chose to group the schools’ data into 3 geographic regions, Southern California, Central California, and Northern California schools, in order to motivate the analysis as a competition, or ‘California College Civil War’. From there, I created three research questions of interest to compare the schools across the three regions using statistical analysis techniques and visualizations to display my findings.\n\n\n\nThis slideshow was part of a presentation I gave during an internship in which I was tasked with doing industrial real estate market research on the city of Rockford, IL for speculative development. I sourced all of my information from credible websites and analyzed CoStar data in Alteryx to create several summary tables and geographic visualizations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese are all graphics design projects I have completed by myself using Adobe Photoshop and Photopea for various extracurricular activities and groups.\n\nBand PostersLogosCover ArtBand GraphicsParty Posters\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ns\n\n\nIn this project for STAT 541 - Advanced Statistical Computing with R at Cal Poly, we had to create our own package in R. We created the “AssumpCheckR” package, which provides 3 new functions to help check three assumptions made about your data when fitting a linear model: check_linearity(), check_normality(), and check_variance(). There are several other functions in the package that help to check these assumptions, including making plots, using tests, and generating interpretations of the results.\nhttps://github.com/jack23brown/AssumpCheckR"
